**Disclaimer:** the number of commits of each github account does not represent the actual amount of worktime and codelines of each member of the team; this is because most of the project was done while all the team members where working together in the same place, and usually the commit procedure was preceded by a code-merging phase, in which the various parts of the new codelines (already tested) were reviewed and merged.
